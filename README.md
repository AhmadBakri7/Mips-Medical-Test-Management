# Medical Test Management System

## Overview
This project is a Medical Test Management System developed using MIPS assembly language. The system is designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve medical test data for individual patients. It acts as a basic patient record management system focusing on test results.

## Features
• Add New Medical Test: Store a new medical test with required data, including patient ID, test name, test date, and result. The system checks the validity of the input data.

• Search for a Test by Patient ID: 

  * Retrieve all patient tests.

  * Retrieve all abnormal patient tests.

  * Retrieve all patient tests within a specified period.


• Search for Abnormal Tests: Retrieve all abnormal patient tests based on the input medical test.

• Average Test Value: Calculate and retrieve the average value of each medical test.

• Update Existing Test Result: Modify the result of an already existing medical test.

• Delete a Test: Remove a medical test from the system.

• Error Handling: The system includes robust error handling for invalid file names, non-existent tests, non-existent patient IDs, and more.

• Data Validation: Validates user input to ensure proper data types (e.g., integers for ID, valid dates) and handles potential errors.

## System Functionality
The system is built with a text-based menu, allowing users to:
  * Add, update, and delete medical tests.
  * Search and retrieve tests based on various criteria.
  * Calculate average test values.
  * Handle errors and validate data inputs.
